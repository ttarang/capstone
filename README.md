# Conclusion

### Recommendations
Our final model detects the presence of TVâ€“MA content in context approximately 97% of the time. The model is able to intake any number of text blocks of any length and almost perfectly identify the presence of unwanted content.

### Next Steps
* Find & adapt music scores corresponding to lyrics generated.
